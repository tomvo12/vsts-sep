#Check and create vsts service endpoints

This small sample program demonstrated how to create and delete VSTS service endpoints by using the [VSTS REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts/).

Depending on the service endpoint type, you might need to set other properties. You can find documentation of the different endpoint types [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/library/service-endpoints?view=vsts).

You can also programmatically read out the endpoint types using the REST API as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts/serviceendpoint/types/list).

Good luck, Tom!
